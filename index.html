    <h2>Federal Readiness, Grants, Strategic Documents & Asset Recovery</h2>

    <p><strong>Let’s be clear: everything is downstream of SAM.gov.</strong> If you're a nonprofit, a for-profit, a community development initiative, a tribal agency, or a public-private partnership — you need to be registered in the federal System for Award Management (SAM) to access funding, bid contracts, or receive disaster assistance. I can guide you through that process, fully and professionally.</p>

    <p>Whether you're applying for grants, bidding on local infrastructure funded by federal dollars, forming a new LLC to pursue government work, or simply trying to understand how to get started — I provide strategic help, customized documentation, and operational alignment for federal and quasi-federal engagement.</p>

    <h3>What I Offer</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SAM.gov Registration & Entity Setup:</strong> Full, compliant registration — no shortcuts, no confusion.</li>
      <li><strong>Capability Statements:</strong> Tailored to your industry, mission, and goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Grant Readiness & Application Support:</strong> From eligibility screening to full submission.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic Document Creation:</strong> Operating agreements, business plans, executive summaries, technical narratives, and budgets that meet federal expectations.</li>
      <li><strong>LLC Setup & Formation:</strong> EIN, business structure, registration, and internal controls setup.</li>
      <li><strong>Unclaimed Funds Recovery:</strong> Through King David Contracting's service line <em>The Asset Locator</em>, I help individuals and businesses identify and recover lost assets from over 40 federal, state, and corporate databases. Using secure automation and escrow safeguards, I simplify recovery and return control to rightful owners. To begin a search, send your full name and any previous addresses to <a href="mailto:info@theassetlocator.com">info@theassetlocator.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Reality</h3>
    <p>SAM.gov registration and grant alignment aren’t quick tasks. They require accurate information, legal understanding, and technical fluency. A missed NAICS code, a wrong certification box, or a poorly worded capability statement can shut you out for good.</p>

    <p>I’ve done the work, passed the checkpoints, and navigated the bureaucracy — not only for myself, but for others who came to me overwhelmed or overlooked. I won’t help anyone falsify or exaggerate. But if you're serious about access, growth, and legitimacy, I can help you build it the right way.</p>

    <h3>Who This Is For</h3>
    <p>These services are tailored for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Entrepreneurs and LLC owners seeking federal contracts</li>
      <li>Nonprofits and community groups pursuing federal and state grants</li>
      <li>Local government or redevelopment groups in need of compliance documents</li>
      <li>Anyone curious whether they have unclaimed assets waiting to be recovered</li>
    </ul>
